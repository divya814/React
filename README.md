## Journey of Learning React.js
<br>
1). Creat a React App using- create-react-app 'name-of-app' <br>
2). Copy any folder from this repo to your local device or the whole repo<br>
3). Copy the App.js file from its src folder or just copy the whole folder<br>
4). Paste it in your created React App folder and delete its original App.js file<br>
5). Copy and paste the whole Components folder as it is to your created React App.<br>

#### Happy Coding!
